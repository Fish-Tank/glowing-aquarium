# Fishing Tournament Program


## Introduction
This program was created to hold fishing tournaments on multiple lakes with multiple participants. The participating fishermen can create an account, register the fish caught and view the tournament rankings for each species allowed in the tournament.
The fishing tournament organsier can easily update the species for a giveen tournament by adapting the fish index.
In addition, fishermen can create an account with their e-mail addresses, through which the organizer can send updated rankings to all participants at the end of the day and contact the winners of each category. Apart from that, the program can show you various inforamtion about the catches from several lakes (biggest catches, average of the length and quantity of the caught fish). It should be noted that since this program is new, only some species can be entered into the program and inforamtion can be taken from a few lakes.

## Supported Versions
