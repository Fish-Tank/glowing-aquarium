# Fishing Tournament Program


## Introduction
This program was created to hold fishing tournaments on multiple lakes with multiple participants. The participating fishermen can create an account, register the fish they have caught and consult the tournament rankings for each species allowed in the tournament. 
The fishing tournament organsier can easily update the species for a giveen tournament by adapting the fish index.
In addition fishermen can create an account with their email adresses, where the organisator can send updated leaderboards at the end of the day to all participants and get in contact with the winners of each category.
